<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>The concept of NFL Pick 'Em is simple: pick the winners of each game each week.</p>
<p>Entry fee for the season is $20 with possible weekly pot of additional $10.</p>
<p>Players with entry fee not paid by the first game will be removed. </p>
<p>To enter, fill in the entry form by selecting the winner of each game.</p>
<p>The player who accurately predicts the most correct winners each week gets a win.  If two players share the winning score for a week, the win is awarded to both players.</p>
<p>At the end of the football season the person who has the highest overall pick ratio (correct picks / total picks), is the winner.  The final tie breaker is determined by who has the most weekly wins. If needed at the end of the season players will pick the score to the final game.</p>

<h2>Making and Changing Entries</h2>
<p>When filling in an entry form, you do not have to make a pick for each game.  This is helpful if there are early games scheduled for a given week (games played on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday). You may make your picks for these games beforehand and complete the rest later.</p>
<p>Games are automatically locked out on the entry form according to their scheduled date and time. Early games are locked at the start of the individual game. All remaining games (including the Monday Night Football game) are locked at the scheduled start time of the first Sunday game.</p>
<p>Note: all times displayed on the schedule are Mountain Time.</p>
<p>You may change your pick for any game up until the time that game is locked.</p>
<p>Entries must be completed on time. Once a game is locked, you may not change your pick for it. If you did not make a pick for a particular game, it is counted as a loss. If you submit a partial entry and either forget or are unable to complete it, the games you did not pick will count as losses.</p>
<p>If you have trouble accessing the site, logging in or completing your entry, please contact the Administrator for help.  If you are unable to make your picks before they are locked out, the Administrator may enter your picks after the fact if the picks are communicated to the Administrator ahead of time.</p>
